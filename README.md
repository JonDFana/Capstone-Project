# Project Summary
The project contains a report my team and I developed as a capstone project for the Business Analytics course at Seneca College. The thesis goes about the unfairness in the mortgage lending industry as it was unmasked back in 2021. The main objective of the research is to replicate processes that lead to unfair lending practices. In this repository you will find:

**report.docx**: a full report covering all the steps of the investigation. It encloses 10 sections and 8 subsections for a broad coverage of the issue on hand. Expect to come across many statistics terms as it was written targeting a technical audience.

**presentation.pptx:** It includes the findings and conclusion of the project divided in 12. Although it was originally intended for a face-to-face exhibition in class, comments were added to some slides to offset the lack of a presenter. Going through this material should take over 5 minutes.

**capstone.ipynp**: It is the Python code employed to land at the final results of the investigation. Despite the many graphs it has, the final charts used in the presentation were imported into the Final Project using Tableau.

**Loan_Train.csv:** target dataset for the investigation. Link is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/granjithkumar/loan-approval-data-set?source=post_page-----892ee3cb59f7--------------------------------

Hope you enjoy the reading and notice the passion and effort put into the thesis :).
